The "AI system (CNN first system)" file contains within it the algorithms and network architecture that were used in the first part of the project (i.e. diagnosis using only images before starting to use diagnostic information)
The "cases after processing" file contains several cases that have been processed and all the images for each case are combined into one image (the cancer appears more clearly as it is blue in color and the healthy tissue is red in color).
The file "entering descriptive information and the result of the first system" is a file that contains the algorithm built to collect the information into a single matrix to be entered into the second part of the system (the diagnostic result of the cnn system, patient age, prostate size,...), and also contains instructions to test the accuracy of the systems.
The "hybrid AI system" file is a file that contains all six hybrid AI systems after training 
There is also a video of the program's operation 
The "colorpic.m" file is a file that contains the initial processing of images and converting them from DICOM to PNG.
